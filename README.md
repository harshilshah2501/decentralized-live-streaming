# Decentralized Live Streaming Network

This project demonstrates a WebRTC-powered decentralized live-streaming network where viewers act as relays, reducing server load.

## Features
- Peer-to-peer live streaming with WebRTC
- Decentralized architecture for scalability
- Metrics monitoring and failover support

## Technologies
- WebRTC
- Node.js for signaling server
- OpenStack and Terraform for deployment

## Getting Started
### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend/` folder.
2. Run `node server.js` to start the signaling server.

### Frontend
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Connect peers to test the live-streaming feature.

## Future Enhancements
- Quality monitoring
- Multi-stream support
